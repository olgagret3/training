  <h1>Re: Eillen Dover university application</h1>
  <p>
    Dear Eillen,
    <br /><br />
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study 
    as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> nex year. I will answer your questions 
    one by one, in the following sections.
  </p>
  <h2>Starting dates</h2>
  <p>

  <h2>Subjects of study</h2>
  <p>
    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the subjects fall 
    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just 
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued 
    by are as follows, in order of priority:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol 
        (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30&deg;С (86&deg;F), when the 
        audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> &gt; 3 &times; 10<sup>4</sup>.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 
        constructs for representing musical scores.
      </li>
    </ol>
    So please can you provide more information on each of there subjects, including how long you'd expect the 
    research to take, required staff and resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know?
    <br />
    Thanks.

  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>
  <p>
    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. 
    To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
    <dl>
      <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
      <dd>
        A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300 <abbr title="Before Christ">BC</abbr>, 
        a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful".
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dd>
      <dd>
        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, 
        which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in 
        imperceptably tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance 
        inspired modern styles such as Twerking.
      </dd>
      
      <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
      <dd>
        An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have 
        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants 
        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this 
        because they were really cold.
